I am Piotr and I am a deep learning engineer with corporate and startup experience. I am currently looking for a challenging project, ideally in computer vision. 




# Some of my latest projects

## ![Real-Time CV](https://github.com/plachert/real_time_cv)
Streamlit app based on streamlit-webrtc for visualising CV (Computer Vision) tasks in real time. I created this tool while working on a segmentation task. I wanted to evaluate the model's performance in real time and feed it with any input I desired (webcamera, video file or a set of images).

### Stream from file

### Stream from webcam

## ![Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/plachert/neural-style-transfer) and ![DeepDream](https://github.com/plachert/deep-dream-visualiser)
Implementing those two popular algorithms and experimenting with the parameters was fun. I wrapped everything up in streamlit apps. Since these algorithms involve extensive manipulations of the intermediate layers of the model, I came up with the idea of creating a tool for that purpose - ![Activation Tracker](https://github.com/plachert/activation_tracker)

### NST

### DeepDream

## ![Activation Tracker](https://github.com/plachert/activation_tracker)
A package that provides a wrapper for `torch.nn.Module` to keep track of all intermediate layers of the model, along with a strategy to filter the activations. This comes in extremely handy when working with algorithms such as DeepDream or NST. Also, it can be used for debugging and feature maps visualisation.
