I am Piotr and I am a deep learning enthusiast and practitioner with corporate and startup experience. I am currently looking for a challenging project, ideally in computer vision. 




# Some of my latest projects

## ![Real-Time CV](https://github.com/plachert/real_time_cv)
Streamlit app based on streamlit-webrtc for visualising CV (Computer Vision) tasks in real time. I created this tool while working on a segmentation task. I wanted to evaluate the performance of the model in real time and feed the model with whatever I want (webcamera, video file or a set of images).
