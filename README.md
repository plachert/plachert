I am Piotr and I am a deep learning engineer with corporate and startup experience. I am currently looking for a challenging project, ideally in computer vision. 




# Some of my latest projects

## ![Real-Time CV](https://github.com/plachert/real_time_cv)
Streamlit app based on streamlit-webrtc for visualising CV (Computer Vision) tasks in real time. I created this tool while working on a segmentation task. I wanted to evaluate the performance of the model in real time and feed the model with whatever I want (webcamera, video file or a set of images).

### Stream from webcam

## ![Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/plachert/neural-style-transfer) and ![DeepDream](https://github.com/plachert/deep-dream-visualiser)
Implementation of those two popular algorithms and experimenting with the parameters was fun. I wrapped everything up in streamlit apps. As these algorithms require a lot of maniuplations on intermediate layers of the model I came up with an idea of creating a tool for that - ![Activation Tracker](https://github.com/plachert/activation_tracker)

### NST

### DeepDream

## ![Activation Tracker](https://github.com/plachert/activation_tracker)
A package that provides a wrapper for `torch.nn.Module` that keeps track of all intermediate layers of the model along with some strategy to filter the activations. This comes in extremely handy when working with algorithms such as DeepDream or NST. Also, it can be used for debugging and feature maps visualisation.
